# Welcome to Team Building!

## Introduction

This site is a way for me to keep a collection of team building activities. As a facilitator of team building and leadership initiatives, I have many activities, games and initiatives to keep track of.

## Games

There are many types of activities we use: ice breakers, initiatives, and debriefs. This site will allow a user to log a new game and see all the games.
