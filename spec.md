Confirm
- [x] You have a large number of small Git commits
        -I tried to commit for each little task I did. Large commits are mostly from creating the initial files.

- [x] Your commit messages are meaningful
        -Messages are short but give details to remind me what each commit includes

- [x] You made the changes in a commit that relate to the commit message
        -Most commit messages contain only what happened in the commit... as long as I committed before falling asleep for the night.

- [x] You don't include changes in a commit that aren't related to the commit message
        -I did my best with it. It does take getting used to committing when we don't use them for every lab.
